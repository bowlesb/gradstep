# The equation view (2026-10-15)

Owner: "when you click on an equation, you can enter a custom view next to Explain in Chat that allows you to see the
equations much more clearly. You can update the size of the equation, with an optional horizontal scroll option. And
in addition each parameter or symbol is clearly described below. The description can also use AI in case some symbols
are not described fully in the paper. There should be an option to seek more background below, as optional, to help
users understand the equation. It should reuse the same cache as chat. There should be an easy link from that UX to
the chat."

## Where it opens

Tapping an equation already selects it and offers Explain in Chat, Why it matters, Related papers. A new action,
**Equation** (`function` symbol on Apple), sits right after Explain in Chat and opens the view; the others are unchanged
and keep their order. The browser's selection bar gains the same button, in the same place, when the selection is one
equation.

## What it shows, top to bottom

1. **The equation, large.** The reader's own rendering of that equation (its MathML, or the formula image a device-PDF
   bundle holds), in the reader's colours. A size control (A− / A+, 100 % to 400 % of the reader's text size, starting
   at 160 %) and a **Scroll sideways** toggle: off, the equation is scaled down to fit the width when it is wider; on,
   it keeps the chosen size and scrolls horizontally. The equation number, when it has one, stays beside it.
2. **What it says**: the one- or two-sentence summary.
3. **Symbols**: one row per symbol, in order of appearance: the symbol (plain Unicode text as the model wrote it,
   e.g. `π_θ(y|x)`), its meaning, and where that comes from — **From the paper ¶N** (a link: closes the view and
   scrolls the reader to that paragraph, with Back to return), or **General meaning** (the paper does not define it;
   worded as usual usage). While the request runs the rows show a quiet loading state; a failure shows the reason and
   Try again.
4. **More background** (a button; optional, never automatic): streams a short explainer under it (what problem the
   equation solves, the intuition per term, prerequisite concepts, a small example), rendered like a chat answer with
   its `[¶N]` citations working.
5. **Ask in chat**: closes the view and opens the paper's chat with this equation as the selected passage and the
   composer focused, so the reader types their own question (no answer is sent automatically). Explain in Chat stays in
   the tap menu as before.

The view is a sheet on iPhone (large detent), a sheet or inspector-width panel on iPad and Mac, and a right-side dialog
in the browser; Escape / Done closes it.

## The requests: chat actions on the chat's cache

Both are ordinary chat requests (`POST /functions/v1/chat`, hold → answer → settle, credits shown after) with:

| field | value |
|---|---|
| `mode` | `paper` |
| `local_context` | the paper on the device, `reader-local-context-v2` (numbered `[¶N]`), exactly as chat sends it |
| `selection.quote` | the equation's LaTeX (`data-latex`), else its text |
| `messages` | one user turn: `Equation (4)` (its number) or `Equation` |
| `action` | `equation` (symbols) or `equation_background` |
| `profile`, `capabilities`, `consent_version` | the reader's chat defaults and this device's capabilities, as its chat would send them |
| `topic_title`, `follow_ups`, `figures` | absent (rejected) |

The server keeps the chat's prefix byte-identical — same model, tools, shared instructions and cached paper — and puts
only the action's own instructions after the paper, so an equation request right after chatting reads the paper from
the prompt cache, and chatting after the equation view does too (`tests/backend/chat.test.ts`). `equation` holds the
model's text back, checks it (`chat-equation.ts`) and relays one event:

```
event: equation
data: {"format":"equation-symbols-v1","summary":"…","symbols":[{"symbol":"β","latex":"\\beta","meaning":"…","source":"paper","paragraph":2},
       {"symbol":"σ","meaning":"…","source":"general"}]}
```

then `done` (credits). A paragraph number outside the paper turns the symbol into `general`. When the model wrote no
usable JSON the words come as one `delta` instead: show them as the description. `equation_background` streams
`delta`s like any answer, then `done`. No tool result is relayed for either.

## On the device

Results are kept on the device per paper revision (manifest), equation id, action and chat profile (model, effort,
length: a different length writes a different background), in the app's cache (not synced, not in chat history):
reopening an equation shows them without a new request. Apple apps: sealed with the account's local key in
`<environment>/<account>/equation-answers` (complete file protection, excluded from backup, at most 400;
`EquationResultStore`). The symbols request starts when
the view opens (the view's purpose; a few credits with the paper cached); background only on its button. Nothing is
sent without chat consent: the view asks for it as chat does.

## Proof

- Server: `tests/backend/chat.test.ts` (validation, identical cached prefix, checked symbols, fallback, background).
- Live: `node scripts/chat-live-smoke.mjs --equation` on DPO's loss.
- Apps: a fixture mode `--chat-fixture-mode=equation` and a journey that opens the view from a tapped equation.
- Browser: `e2e/equation-view.spec.ts` against the fixture backend's `equation` event.
